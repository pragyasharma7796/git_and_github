Version control system (vcs), also known as Source Code Management (SCM) is a fundamental tool used in
software development and other collaborative projects to manage and track changes to files over time. VCSs
are an Integral part of the development process and a must-have tool for both individual developers and
teams as well.
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time. It allows you to track the
history of changes, collaborate with others, and manage multiple versions of a project. Version control is
commonly used in software development, but it can also be applied to any context where files need to be
tracked and shared.

Need of Version Control System-

Version Control Systems (vCS) are crucial tools in software development, and understanding their importance
Is essential, especially for beginners.
Heres on explanation of the need for a version control system:
. TrackIng History changes - A VCS records all changes to project files, allowing developers to track why and
when changes occurred, aiding debugging and project understanding.
• Collaboration or Parallel development - In software development, team members often work
simultaneously on the same project. VCS enables collaboration through branches, simplifying the
combination of changes.
. Backup and Disaster Recovery - VCS serves as a backup system for project code. Even if a developers local
copy is lost or damaged, the projects history on the central server ensures data safety.
. Code Reviews and Quality Assurance - VCS enables code reviews, allowing team members to assess code
quality, adherence to standards, and issues before merging it.
• Experimentation and Rollback- Developers can experiment in separate branches without impacting the
main project If an experiment fails, branches can be easily discarded, returning to the previous state.
. Release Management - VCS aids software release management by tagging specific code versions,
ensuring consistent and reliable software releases.
. Traceability and Documentation - VCS offers an audit trail, documenting changes and providing context for
project history and decisions.
. Conflict Resolution - When developers simultaneously modify the same code, VCS tools help resolve
conflicts systematically, highlighting necessary changes.
. Open Source and Collaboration Beyond Teams - VCS tools are vital for open-source projects, enabling
global collaboration and maintaining code quality.
